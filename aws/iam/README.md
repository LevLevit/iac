# Overview

This module updates the identify and access management configuration to set up roles and
policies to support System Manager related operations, such as automatic patching, and 
policies, groups, and users for developers and developer admins.

# User Management

This module has a variable called "user_groups" in variables.tf that you'll update to 
create your users.  You can put users in one of two groups: dev or dev-admin.  

In addition to creating users and groups we also generate a keypair for each user.  These
keypairs can be used to authenticate users using the AWS CLI.  We do not set up console 
access for users at this time.  

To protect a user's secret key we require that each user provide a GPG public key, which 
we'll use to encrypt the users secret key.  Public keys reside in files under $IAC_HOME/keys.
They are named as ${user}-gpg.pub.

## Using GPG to encrypt generated keypairs

If you don't use GPG to encrypt the secrets generated by Terraform they will be stored
in clear text in the state file(s).  To avoid this we'll use a user's GPG public key
to encrypt his or her key pair secret.  This is provided back to the user encrypted and
they'll use GPG to decrypt it.

### Install

For users, the set up is simple.  You can google how to do this for your OS.  On Mac:

```
brew install gnupg
```

Add the following to whatever you use to initialize environment variables:

```
# GPG
GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export GPG_TTY
```

### Generate keys

```
gpg --generate-key
```

### List keys

```
gpg --list-keys
```

### Copy public key to $IAC_HOME/keys

You can use any attribute of the public key to export it.  I have "Dan" in my full
name so the command below works.  Use --list-keys to find what you need.  The key
will have an identifier that you could use as well or use your e-mail address.

```
gpg --export Dan | base64 > $IAC_HOME/keys/dan-gpg.pub
```

## Decrypt a Key Pair secret

All of the users specified in var.user_groups will get a key pair and the associated
secret will be encrypted with his or her GPG key (stored in $IAC_HOME/keys/user-gpg.pub).  

```
cd $IAC_HOME/aws/iam
terraform output --json | jq -r '.user_key_id.value[]'
```

### Get key and decrypt it

Send an entire stanza to your user.  Note the secret below is edited for brevity.

```
{
  "id": "AKX123...",
  "secret": "wcBURzAiUZHrZulpnTCN7LP+lsmWH/WHjPUBK9h6w7EWsgwUbJauP7Al8I3QmdpcqOxeDB4Gr60UkCVt==
  "user": "dan.test"
}
```

The user will do something like:

```
echo "wcBMA6VJNd0Ej4fREA3454354345345345345345345345A...==" | base64 --decode | gpg --decrypt 
```

For yourself:

```
terraform output --json | jq -r '.user_key_id.value[] | select(.user=="dan.test") | .secret' \
    | base64 --decode \
    | gpg --decrypt --quiet
```
