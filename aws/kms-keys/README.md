# Overview

KMS manages encryption keys generated by an AWS customer or customer managed keys (CMKs).
KMS keys are a critical part of data confidentiality.  Keys are also an important part of
data availability.  If keys are deleted, data encrypted with those keys is unreadable and
therefore unavailable to anyone including authorized parties.  As a result, it can be a 
compliance issue if keys are scheduled for deletion.

kms-cmk-not-scheduled-for-deletion-conformance-pack is the AWS Config check that will 
flag this situation.  It's part of the CMMC Level 3 conformance pack and we endeavor to 
comply with CMMC Level 3 when configured to do so.

# KMS Module and Build Control

We create a dedicated KMS module to create our keys.  Keys will be created but will not be
deleted.  The ensures that keys will always be available.  If keys must be deleted, they 
are removed from the module and when Terraform applies the changes the keys will go away.
This is a deliberate action and not part of the typical spin up and down of resources.
